Labs for COSC 307: Honors Data Structures &amp; Algorithms II at UTK

- HLab1 - Radio Range topcoder
- HLab2 - Black White Rectangles topcoder
- HLab3 - Find the Perfect Triangle topcoder
- HLab4 - From To Divisible topcoder
- HLab5 - Bear Cries topcoder
- Lab 1 (lib_info.cpp) - Read in MP3 files and print them out in a specific format.
- Lab 2 (hashlyvania) - Randomly order people given their names and IDs using hashing.
- Lab 3 (cs302-midi) - Converts Midi-Event Files to and from Midi-Note Files.
- Lab 4 (matrix_enum) - Perform enumerations on square matrices.
- Lab 5 - Superball game AI
- Lab 6 - Merge sort and quick sort
- Lab 7 (maze_solve) - Create a graph of the maze given the number of rows, columns, and walls. Solve using depth first search
- Lab 8 - Create a graph of intersections and use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from light[0, 0] to light[max_street, max_avenue].
- Lab 9 (worddice.cpp) - Use network flow to figure out which given dice to use to spell specific words.
- Lab A (dond.cpp) - A contestent will be given a s-sided die numbered from 0 to s-1, and a certain number of times that they must roll that die. Call that number t. On each roll after the first, if the contestant rolls a number that equals the previous number that they rolled, or is one away from the number that they previously rolled, they lose.
